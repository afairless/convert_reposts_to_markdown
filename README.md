The code in this repository converts a set of re-posts from a SQL dump file from a Wordpress website (and the original text file that compiles the re-posts for the website) to a set of markdown files with front matter appropriate for a [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) static website.

Dependencies and orchestration are managed by [Pixi](https://prefix.dev/).
